# Isaac's Blog

I've had a blog for years but rarely publish anything, in part because I haven't made time for it and am quite busy, but also because the stack I was using for ye olde blog was quite out of date. It was an Octopress blog, and writing posts required committing and publishing them to regenerate the static site.

This is the latest version of my blog and website powered by the wonderful [nextjs-notion-starter-kit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit). Writing posts is as simple as creating a page in my beloved [Notion](https://notion.so). ðŸ”¥
